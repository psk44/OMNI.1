# OMNI.1

[[Python]] [[AI]] [[Automation]] [[Project-Ideas]]

**OMNI.1** is a Python-based project designed as a foundation for advanced automation, AI experimentation, and universal tool-building. The vision is to create a modular, extensible system that can evolve into a personal digital assistant, automation hub, or experimental AI Code Playground.

This project is a living artifact—meant to be iterated upon, refactored, and expanded as new ideas and technologies emerge. It is a reflection of the philosophy that software should be both a tool and a canvas for personal and universal growth.

## Features

- **Python Core:** Built with Python for maximum flexibility and rapid prototyping.
- **Single Entry Point:** All logic currently resides in `omni1.py` for simplicity.
- **Modular Philosophy:** Designed to be extended with new modules, plugins, or integrations.
- **Open-Ended Purpose:** Intended as a base for automation, AI, data analysis, or any creative coding pursuit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/psk44/OMNI.1.git
cd OMNI.1
```

Install any required dependencies (if/when added):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python omni1.py
```

## Project Philosophy

OMNI.1 is inspired by the idea of universal tools—software that adapts to the user’s needs, grows with their knowledge, and serves as a platform for both practical and philosophical exploration. The project draws on lessons from:

- The history of automation (from ancient Greek automata to modern AI)
- The philosophy of tool-making (see *The Craftsman* by Richard Sennett)
- The psychology of creativity and self-improvement (see *Flow* by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi)
- The open-source ethos of sharing and iterative improvement

## Roadmap

- [ ] Modularize codebase for plugins/extensions
- [ ] Add configuration and settings management
- [ ] Integrate with external APIs (e.g., for AI, data, or automation)
- [ ] Build a CLI or web interface
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation and tests
